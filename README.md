# Baumschule
Blender addon to create game ready trees. This addon is a modification of "Sapling_Tree", https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Curve/Sapling_Treeby Andrew Hale (TrumanBlending) and Aaron Buchler.
It’s intention is to improve the process of creating a game ready asset. Applying materials and unwrapping is part of the addon. Tree properties are saved and can be changed at any time.
